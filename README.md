Nigger, nigger
Tellin' lies
Black face and bloodshot eyes
Crooked toes and crooked nose
That's the way a nigger goes
(That's how he goes)

They're marching for equality
They'll never be as good as me
We won't let them integrate
We must only segragate
(Keep 'em in their places)

Nigger, nigger
Tellin' lies
Black face and bloodshot eyes
Crooked toes and crooked nose
That's the way a nigger goes

Oh, Martin Luther's got to go
That's one thing that we all know
We'll take him ridin' on a rail
And lock him in the county jail

Niggers want to change our ways
But taxes they won't ever pay
Monkey lips and kinky hair
Living off that old welfare
(Got their handout)

They might as well give up the fight
No federal judge can make them white
The job is up to you and me
Let's beat the NAACP
(Move 'em north)

Nigger, nigger
Tellin' lies
Black face and bloodshot eyes
Crooked toes and crooked nose
That's the way a nigger goes

That's the way a nigger goes
That's the way a nigger goes
That's the way a nigger goes
